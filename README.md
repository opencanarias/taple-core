# TAPLE Core
TAPLE (pronounced T+🍎 ['tapəl]) stands for Tracking (Autonomous) of Provenance and Lifecycle Events. TAPLE is a permissioned DLT solution for traceability of assets and processes. It is:

- **Scalable**: Scaling to a sufficient level for traceability use cases. 
- **Light**: Designed to support resource constrained devices.
- **Flexible**: Have a flexible and adaptable cryptographic scheme mechanism for a multitude of scenarios.
- **Energy-efficient**: Rust powered, TAPLE is sustainable and efficient from the point of view of energy consumption.

TAPLE Core is the reference library that implements all the necessary functionality for developing a client that is compatible with TAPLE's DLT network. If you need a client, refer to our [TAPLE Client](https://github.com/opencanarias/taple-client).
