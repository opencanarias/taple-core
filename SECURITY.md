# Security

TAPLE is in an early stage of development and the code is constantly changing. Until the first stable version, 1.0, is released, we will not recommend its use in production, so any security bugs will not be given special consideration.

To ask a question or report a bug consult the [SUPPORT](./SUPPORT.md) file.
